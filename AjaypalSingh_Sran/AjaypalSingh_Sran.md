Internship Assignment â€“ Segmentation & Tracking
This project demonstrates an end-to-end computer vision pipeline for vehicle and pedestrian segmentation and tracking.
Using Labellerr for annotation, YOLOv8-seg for segmentation, and ByteTrack for tracking, the workflow shows how annotated data can be used to train a model and track objects across frames.

The goal is to illustrate the process, not achieve high accuracy.
